	<h2 class="underline"><i>Profile</i></h2>
	<p class="indented">Hi, my name is David. I am 21 years old attending UGA this spring semester as
	<img src="Fotolia_55200468_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg" alt="Business" height="300px" width="200px" style=float:right> 
	a transfer student. I earned my Associates Degree in Sciences from GA State University last fall. 
	I am from Conyers, GA which is just southeast of Atlanta. Lived there my whole life until moving  
	here to Athens. I've done most of my out-of-town traveling inside Georgia and the states bordering it. 
	I did get to go to Mexico on a cruise one time in 9th grade which was a pretty neat. I will be 
	traveling out of the country this summer for an internship in China (dreading the 20+ hour flight already). 
	The past three summers were spent working at a movie theater in my hometown. I started out in the concessions 
	stand and worked my way up to manager in a year and a half. Yes, I could see free movies. No, I did not 
	see every movie that came out. Would you want to spend more time at your place of work on your off days 
	and shifts? I started there summer going into my senior year of high school; I graduated from Heritage 
	class of 2015. I played soccer in middle through highschool, and I    </p>

	<h2 style="text-align:right" class="underline"><i>Interests</i></h2>
	<p class="indented"><img src="Logo_Game_of_Thrones.png" alt="Game of Thrones" height="150px" width="450px" style=float:left>
	Some of the features that best define me are the things I am interested in. 
	For example, anyone who knows me knows that my favorite color is blue-but not just any blue. 
	It has to be royal blue, like the text of these headings. It's kind of a big deal. Also, I love the movie Avatar and the tv show
	(and books) Game of Thrones. They changed they game for film & television 
	industry wide and developed a world-class fanbase. Sadly, the final season to Game of Thrones 
	is next year, but Avatar is getting three more sequels in the coming years! The environments 
	their stories take the audiences to is breathtaking. It reminds us of how beautiful our world 
	really is and should be. My appreciation for nature and its resources has lead me to learning 
	more about conservation and sustainability. I love that UGA takes this very seriously and is 
	always seeking to improve its waste management. Another thing that I have been learning about 
	is the Chinese language- more specifically the common tongue Mandarin. Since I will be spending 
	two months there this summer, I decided I should try and learn as much as I can before I go. 
	It'll be great experience to see the business world from a new perspective and gain insight 
	on the tech industry while I am there (something that I try to keep up with almost religiously). 
	Shenzhen, China is home to the "Silicon Valley Of Asia" and is a huge IT hub. Professionals come 
	from all over the world to do business there and the share new ideas. As great as all of that sounds,
	the main reason I'm going is to try authentic sesame seed chicken. That food has my heart. I love 
	music too, click on the link to check out a few of my

	<h2 class="underline"><i>Goals</i><img src="256px-Icon-Mac.svg.png" alt="Mac" height="180px" width="180px" style=float:right></h2>
	<p class="indented">Currently, I am majoring in Business Management, minoring in Computer Sciences, 
	and working towards the Sustainability Certificate. These are some of my goals over next couple of years, 
	hopefully will be graduating by spring 2020. After college I would like to work for Apple Inc. in management. 
	Apple's values and attentiveness to customer services really resonnate with me, I want to be a part 
	of a company whose goal is to leave the world better than we found it. With my certifications and experiences, 
	I think I will have built up a pretty well established CV by that time. Another one of my goals that I had
	mentioned earlier is to learn Mandarin. I think that would make me a valuable asset in the future, and it'd 
	be neat to speak in the world's most spoken language. Coding is a language that I really want to learn too. 
	I think it's in a growing demand is essential to 21st century business. As great as all of that may sound, 
	my real goal in life in to just simply live well and happy. </p>
